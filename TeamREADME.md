Notes from Brady:
  player.sql is just the sql file on Sprint 2 (and also on the helper github I think)
  python-pg seemed to be the sql database we are supposed to work with so I just built on top of that
  the python-pg lets you enter an id into the database, and then does the check to see if it exists and stuff
