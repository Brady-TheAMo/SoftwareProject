Notes from Brady:
  Game screen can handle base hits and I used the code in 6minutetimer.py to make a working timer for the game as well. Only thing left is traffic generator, keeping players sorted by score, and an overall team score for both teams.


Notes from Matthew:
  Splash screen and player entry screen were combined into main.py for a more seamless UI, this way it does not open 2 different terminal after one another.
  The main.py should make it easier later because I added different game states.
