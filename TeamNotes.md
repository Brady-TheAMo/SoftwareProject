Notes from Brady:
  Game screen can handle base hits and I used the code in 6minutetimer.py to make a working timer for the game as well. Only thing left is traffic generator, keeping players sorted by score, and an overall team score for both teams.


Notes from Matthew:
  Traffic generator runs game correctly and UDP aspect works. Score and everything is updated.
