Notes from Brady:
  player.sql is just the sql file on Sprint 2 (and also on the helper github I think)
  python-pg seemed to be the sql database we are supposed to work with so I just built on top of that
  the python-pg lets you enter an id into the database, and then does the check to see if it exists and stuff


Notes from Matthew:
  Splash screen and player entry screen were combined into main.py for a more seamless UI, this way it does not open 2 different terminal after one another.
  The main.py should make it easier later because I added different game states.
