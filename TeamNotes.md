Notes from Brady:
  Game screen is made, but right now it has no database connection or way to get into it from main. I have some code on my end
  to do it but its a stop gap measure that will bug out the second the new player entry screen is made.


Notes from Matthew:
  Splash screen and player entry screen were combined into main.py for a more seamless UI, this way it does not open 2 different terminal after one another.
  The main.py should make it easier later because I added different game states.
