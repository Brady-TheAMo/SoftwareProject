Notes from Brady:
  Game screen is made, but right now it is ugly and doesn't actually do anything outside of being a still image


Notes from Matthew:
  Splash screen and player entry screen were combined into main.py for a more seamless UI, this way it does not open 2 different terminal after one another.
  The main.py should make it easier later because I added different game states.
